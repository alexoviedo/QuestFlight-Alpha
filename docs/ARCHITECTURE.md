```

The hierarchy exists before frame zero. OpenXR owns tracked camera motion. Calibration modifies only `UserViewCalibrationOffset`. Input produces a neutral control snapshot consumed by one `FlightDynamicsCoordinator`; `UnityPrototypeFlightBackend` is the sole serialized authority. Environment geometry, runway, water, and immutable far terrain are authored assets rather than runtime reconstruction.

The product Credits/About surface must expose the KOG_THORNS CC BY 4.0 attribution and `© OpenStreetMap contributors` with the ODbL URL. A missing or hash-mismatched aircraft asset is an Editor/build failure; the runtime never downloads or reconstructs it.
